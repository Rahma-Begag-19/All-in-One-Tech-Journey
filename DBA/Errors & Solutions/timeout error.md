Timeout errors when using PgBouncer are common, especially when connection pooling and query execution settings are not optimized for your workload. Letâ€™s go through the possible PgBouncer-specific timeout errors, their causes, and solutions:

## 1. Query Timeout (pgbouncer: query timeout)
**Error Message:** pgbouncer: query timeout.<br>
**Cause:** The query exceeded the query_timeout value in the PgBouncer configuration. <br>
This timeout applies to how long a query is allowed to execute.<br>
**Solution:**
> Increase the query_timeout in the pgbouncer.ini file:
>```bash
>query_timeout = 300  # 5 minutes
>```
>Restart PgBouncer after making the change:
>```bash
>systemctl restart pgbouncer
>```
>Optimize slow queries using indexing or better query planning to complete them faster.
## 2. Client Connection Timeout (pgbouncer: client idle timeout)
**Error Message:** pgbouncer: client idle timeout <br>
**Cause:** The client was idle for longer than the client_idle_timeout value.<br>
**Solution:**
>Increase the client_idle_timeout:
>```bash
>client_idle_timeout = 600  # 10 minutes
>```
>Encourage applications to properly close idle connections by ensuring they release database connections promptly.
## 3. Server Connection Timeout (pgbouncer: server login timeout)
**Error Message:** pgbouncer: server login timeout<br>
**Cause:** PgBouncer couldn't establish a connection to the backend server within the server_login_retry or due to network latency.<br>
**Solution:**
>Check the PostgreSQL server health and connectivity.<br>
>Increase server_login_retry to give more time for server connection retries:
>```bash
>server_login_retry = 15  # Retry every 15 seconds
>```
## 4. Pool Timeout (pgbouncer: pool timeout)
**Error Message:** pgbouncer: pool timeout<br>
**Cause:** The connection pool was full, and no connections were available within the pool_mode timeout.<br>
**Solution:**
>Increase the pool size in pgbouncer.ini:
>```bash
>max_client_conn = 200  # Increase client connections
>default_pool_size = 50  # Increase the pool size per database/user
>```
>Ensure applications use persistent connections or properly close unused connections to avoid saturating the pool.
## 5. Client Wait Timeout (pgbouncer: client wait timeout)
**Error Message:** pgbouncer: client wait timeout<br>
**Cause:** A client connection waited longer than the client_login_timeout to acquire a connection from the pool.<br>
**Solution:**
>Increase the client_login_timeout in pgbouncer.ini:
>```bash
>client_login_timeout = 60  # 60 seconds
>```
>Check for long-running transactions and terminate them to free up connections.
## 6. Idle Transaction Timeout (pgbouncer: server_idle_transaction_timeout)
**Error Message:** pgbouncer: server idle transaction timeout<br>
**Cause:** A connection was idle in a transaction for longer than server_idle_transaction_timeout.<br>
**Solution:**
>Increase server_idle_transaction_timeout in pgbouncer.ini:
>```bash
>server_idle_transaction_timeout = 300  # 5 minutes
>```
>Ensure that applications commit or roll back transactions promptly.

# General Troubleshooting Steps for PgBouncer Timeout Errors
- **Check Logs:**

PgBouncer logs provide detailed information about timeout errors.
Location: /var/log/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.log or as defined in your configuration.<br>
- **Monitor Connection Pool:**

Use the SHOW POOLS; command in PgBouncer to check pool usage:
```bash
SHOW POOLS;
```
- **Test Query Behavior:**

Run the slow queries directly on PostgreSQL using EXPLAIN ANALYZE to see why they are slow.

- **Adjust PgBouncer Parameters:**

Tune timeouts (query_timeout, client_idle_timeout, etc.) based on workload.

- **Optimize Queries:**

Focus on reducing query execution time by optimizing SQL statements, using appropriate indexes, and analyzing execution plans.
